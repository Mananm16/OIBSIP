        <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar(14 April 1891 - 6 December 1956), also known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and 
        social reformer who inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social discrimination towards the untouchables (Dalits). 
        He was independent India's first law and justice minister, the major architect of the Constitution of India.</p>

        <p>Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the London School of Economics, 
        and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. In his early career he was an economist, 
        professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence,
        publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. 
        In 1956 he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.</p>

        <p>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.</p>
